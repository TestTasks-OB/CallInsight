# requirements

- Record a call audio (nice to have â€“ as a Team bot)
- Use the Whisper model (local or OpenAI hosted) to produce a call transcript. Augment the transcript with detected speakers
- Using the transcript and an LLM of choice:
- - Do a summary / abstract of the call
- - Extract key action items
- Store the summary in any note taking software (preferably OneNote)
- (Nice to have): Send all call attendees the email with the summary & action items
